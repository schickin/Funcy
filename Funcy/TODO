TODO list for Funcy project

- Implement accumulation of sequences
- Implement (arithmetic) operations on sequences (more generally, map two sequences
  to one)
- Use this to implement more advanced recursive sequences (e.g. primes)
- Test copying of filtered and mapped sequences
- Finalize and test implementation of sequences with a single element
- Implement flatMap
- Implement zipping and unzipping
